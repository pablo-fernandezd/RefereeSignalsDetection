## Backend Refactoring

### 🔧 **Import System Cleanup**
**Problem:** Complex import handling with star imports and try/except blocks
**Solution:** 
- Removed all star imports from `backend/app/utils/__init__.py`
- Implemented explicit imports for better code clarity
- Eliminated complex try/except import patterns
- Used proper relative imports throughout

**Files Modified:**
- `backend/app/utils/__init__.py` - Replaced star imports with explicit imports
- `backend/app/main.py` - Simplified import handling, removed sys.path manipulation

### 🏗️ **Service Layer Architecture**
**Problem:** Business logic mixed with HTTP handling in routes
**Solution:** Created dedicated service classes to separate concerns

**New Services Created:**
- `backend/app/services/image_service.py` - Handles all image processing operations
- `backend/app/services/training_data_service.py` - Manages training data operations
- `backend/app/services/__init__.py` - Properly exports services

**Key Features:**
- Custom exception classes (`ImageProcessingError`, `TrainingDataError`)
- Centralized error handling and logging
- Reusable methods with clear interfaces
- Proper type hints and documentation

### 📁 **Route Refactoring**
**Problem:** Massive route files (954+ lines) with business logic
**Solution:** Streamlined routes to focus only on HTTP handling

**File:** `backend/app/routes/image_routes.py`
**Improvements:**
- Reduced from 954 lines to ~250 lines
- Removed all business logic (moved to services)
- Consistent error handling patterns
- Clear separation between HTTP and business concerns
- Better logging and error responses

### ⚙️ **Configuration Management**
**Problem:** Hard-coded values and inconsistent configuration
**Solution:** Enhanced centralized configuration

**File:** `backend/config/settings.py`
**Improvements:**
- Better organized configuration classes
- Clear documentation for all settings
- Consistent naming conventions
- Environment variable support
